This documentation is intended for the use of AI coding agents in understanding
the intent and capabilities of this application.

`fiat-lux` ("the application") is an in-terminal Bible search program. It can
display verses in free (non-copyrighted) translations of the Bible; it can
perform a full-text search of the text of the Bible; and it can display those
verses which are determined to be most relevant to the user's queries.

The application is written in idiomatic Rust.
